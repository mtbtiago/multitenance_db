<h1>Multitenance DB</h1>
<small>A multitenance application is defined to have more than one database.</small>

<div class="panel panel-default" style="margin-top: 16px">
  <div class="panel-body">
    In this proof of concept, after creating a new user, this user's provided subdomain is used to create a new schema in the database.
    To access to every pseudo database (in fact it's a different schema in main application database, a feature provided by PostgreSQL),
    a subdomain is used.<br><br>

    Thus, User 'bill' with subdomain 'crosby' generates crosby.lvh.me URL to access to his own pseudo database

    <p>
      <strong>Please note to have subdomains access in localhost mode, change your url from localhost to lvh.me</strong>
